Medicare Data Pipeline is an automated ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline built to process and analyze Medicare data. It extracts raw data from a CSV file, transforms it by cleaning and structuring the data, and loads it into a PostgreSQL database for further analysis. The pipeline is orchestrated using Apache Airflow, with Docker used for containerization, ensuring portability and scalability. This project is designed to provide insights into healthcare data, making it suitable for cost analysis, fraud detection, and predictive modeling.
